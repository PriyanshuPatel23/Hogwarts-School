            <h2 class="def"> Founded around the 9th century and 10th century by Godric Gryffindor, Rowena Ravenclaw,
                Helga
                Hufflepuff and
                Salazar Slytherin, Hogwarts was established in the Highlands of Scotland to educate young wizards and
                witches as well as to keep students safe from Muggle persecution. Theory has it that Rowena Ravenclaw
                came
                up with the name of Hogwarts after dreaming of a warty hog that led her to a cliff by a lake. Since
                then,
                Hogwarts educated most wizarding children with residence in Great Britain and Ireland, keeping its
                location
                hidden from other wizarding schools and Muggles.</h2>

                Hogwarts is divided into four houses, each bearing the last name of its founder: Godric Gryffindor,
                Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff. Throughout the school year, the houses compete
                for the House Cup, gaining and losing points based on actions such as performance in class and rule
                violations. The house with the highest end-of-year total wins and has its colours displayed in the Great
                Hall for the following school year. Each house also has its own Quidditch team that competes for the
                Quidditch Cup. These two competitions breed rivalries between the houses. Houses at Hogwarts are living
                and learning communities for their students. Each house is under the authority of one of the Hogwarts
                staff members. The Heads of the houses, as they are called, are in charge of giving their students
                important information, dealing with matters of severe punishment, and responding to emergencies in their
                houses, among other things. The dormitory and common room of a House are, barring rare exceptions,
                inaccessible to students belonging to other Houses; however, different houses will share classes as they
                are based on year group rather than House.
